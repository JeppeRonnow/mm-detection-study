# M&M Detection: OpenCV vs YOLO

Comparing classical computer vision (OpenCV) and modern ML (YOLOv11) for detecting M&Ms on plates.

## About

This project revisits a 2nd semester OpenCV project to compare traditional CV methods with ML.

- **OpenCV**: Color segmentation and contour detection
- **YOLOv11**: Deep learning object detection

## Dataset
- 644 images of M&Ms on plates
- Annotated using Roboflow
- Training set: ~200 images


## Results

Coming soon.
